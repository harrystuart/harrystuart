### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I will be working as a Research Engineer at MBZUAI from November 2025 under the supervision of Tim Baldwin in the NLP department. Having spent the last 5 years of my Machine Learning career in industry, I am excited to transition into more formal research.

My GitHub is a pretty bad reflection of my code contributions as they are typically made to closed-source or hosted privately.
