### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harry Stuart and I am a machine learning engineer from Melbourne, Australia with a wide variety of interests and projects, from cognitive science research to software engineering. I have a particularly keen interest in the theory and mathematics that buttresses advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence.

As you likely expect, 95% of the code I write belongs to the companies I have worked for. However, please feel free to look through my repositores. They are mainly casual personal projects, but still show off some cool tech.
